		<h1>Active IPv6 Scanning Research Using ICMPv6 Probes</h1>
		
		<p>Hi!

		If you've received ICMPv6 Echo Requests from 2001:630:40:f00::f:251, this
		is traffic I'm using to research rate-limiting thresholds
		in advertised IPv6 spaces as part of my PhD.

	 	
		We obtain a list of advertised IPv6 prefixes through public BGP
		data, then select 20% of these advertisements at random for
		scanning. We aim to send only enough traffic necessary to
		establish rate-limiting thresholds, and we select /64s within
		prefixes in a randomised order and we scan one /64 every 5
		seconds in a given advertised range to minimise the chance of
		disruption on selected prefixes.

		If you would like more information or for us to remove your
		range from our scans, please contact me at:

		v.band.1[at]research.gla.ac.uk

		I will aim to respond to your request and/or add your range to
			the scanner exclusion list within 48 hours.
