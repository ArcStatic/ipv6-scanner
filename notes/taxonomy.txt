Taxonomy of IPv6 addresses:

-----------------------
Ranges which can be removed from Internet-wide searches:
- Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) (for Internet-wide scans, still useful on local networks) (fc00::/7) [1]
- Link-Local Addresses (fe80::/10) [1]

Ranges which can be removed from local searches:
- Teredo (IPv6 tunnelling through IPv4 NATs - 2001:0000::/32) [1]
- 6to4 (conversion gateways? 2002::/16) [1]

Ranges which can be removed from both Internet-wide and local searches:
- Benchmarking addresses (2001:0002::/48) [1]
- Orchid (only used for experimental purposes - 2001:0010::/28) [1]
- Documentation only (2001:db8::/32)

Ranges which are insignificant:
- Unspecified (::/128) [1]
- Loopback (::1/128) [1]

Not sure:
- Global Unicast (2000::/3) [1]
- Multicast (no source addresses here for potential hosts, but could be useful for gathering responses from active addresses? ff00::/8) [1]

-------------------------

Useful patterns:

- new devices joining a network send a multicasted solicitation requesting network configuration information - is it possible for a malicious non-router host to eavesdrop on this and obtain potentially useful information (MAC address, etc) [2, section 4.1.1]
	- infected device would already know the local network prefix

- bit 6 of the first byte of a given MAC address is always set to 1 (universal bit) as part of the locally generated interface identifier (IID). 0xfffe is inserted between the organisationally unique identifier (OUD) and the rest of the Ethernet address, as bytes 3 and 4.
	- For a 64-bit IID, 16 bits are fixed, 24 are vendor-specific, and 24 don't seem to match a specific pattern (need to look into this)
	- IID search space is reduced from 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 possible addresses (2^64) to 16,777,215n (2^24) addresses, where n is the number of OUDs being searched for
	- IPv4 address space (2^32) is searchable in about 5 minutes, so 2^24 is entirely feasible for multiple OUDs

- Sequential MAC addresses may be possible if a batch of devices was ordered from a vendor at the same time (particularly in corporate environments)

- VMs can have an IID search space between 8 and 24 bits

- DHCPv6 tends to assign addresses sequentially, so starting search in local networks from [prefix]::1 upwards should be productive [2, section 4.1.2]
	- Should be able to make a reasonable guess at whether sequential allocation is in use based on address of infected host
	- DHCPv6 support is optional, SLAAC is mandatory, but most OSes support both

-------------------------

Potential difficulties:

- Privacy addresses are supposed to replace 'traditional' IIDs based on link-layer addresses, and are designed to be short-lived (preferred for 24h, valid for 7 days) - the random prefix used for these is sent in a router advertisement message, so may be device independent?

- SLAAC addresses are usually used for more stable hosts (ie. servers), while privacy addresses are common for clients

- However... "in the absence of firewall protection for the host, its stable SLAAC address remains liable to be scanned from off-site"
	- Are privacy addresses just aliases for the SLAAC addresses?
	- IoT devices unlikely to have much firewall protection, particularly in domestic networks - use of privacy addresses does not matter for scanning, given that these addresses are mostly used for masking outbound communications rather than deflecting inbound traffic

Papers to look at in more detail later:
- Target Generation for Internet-wide IPv6 Scanning (a lot of stuff about statistical analysis of target generation algorithms and sets of IPv6 seeds) 

-------------------------

Potential tools to use for scanning:
- Entropy/IP
- 6Gen
- modified zmap
- more to be read in RFC7707
